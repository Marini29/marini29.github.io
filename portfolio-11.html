        <h1 class="abstract">Experience</h1>
        <p class="p_abstract">
            During my time at Ford Motor Company in the Mexico City headquarters I perform different roles within the Product Development department. <br><br>
            I started as CAE Engineer for Exterior System, were I was in charge of the structural check for the front and rear fascia of the different platforms (Explorer, Navigator & Mustang). <br>
            On this role I perform structural, modal or thermal analysis for plastic components using software’s like: Abaqus CAE, Hypermesh, Ansa and Catia v5. <br>
            My biggest achievement at this role was the development of a simulation workflow with a specific meshing technic for irregular plastic components (such as frontal grills), that speed up the delivery process by maintaining a good level of correlation with physical tests. <br><br>
            Afterwards, I moved into the task of <strong>Low speed damageability crash </strong>. On this role I was in charge of build the mesh of the front and read end of the car from the CAD model to a mesh type model capable of been integrated in FEA software’s such as Abaqus and LS-Dyna. <br> 
            I performed simulation for the ECE-42 regulation and Part-581 that are simulations to ensure the integrity of vitals components after the low speed impact. <br>
            Once that the simulation was complete, I created different design proposals to structurally increase the performance of specific parts or systems. <br>
            I deeply work in the energy absorber element, understanding it’s functions, material, manufacturing process. Achieving the creating of a mixed system that ensure the integrity of internal components but at the same time meets the softness for pedestrians. <br><br>           
            Along this 3+ years, I received several <strong>trainings</strong> in software’s like <strong>Abaqus CAE, ANSA, Hyperworks, LS-dyna, Team Center, VisMockUp and CATIA v5</strong>. also developed my soft and negotiation skills by working directly with cross-functional teams from different regions and management presentations. <br>Also, I had the opportunity to be involve in the development 4 patents. <br> <br>
            <strong>The following are ilustrative images of online examples that are similar to my work performed</strong>.

        <p class="p_abstract">
            An emergency alert system for a vehicle includes a drone system including a warning sign disposed within a body defining cavity of the vehicle and a controller. The controller is configured to, in response to a user request during a stop, launch the drone system from the cavity and specify drone position relative to the vehicle based on traffic flow around the vehicle to alert other vehicles in a vicinity of the vehicle via the warning sign regarding occurrence of the stop. <br><br>

        <p class="p_abstract">
            A bumper assembly for a motor vehicle includes an energy absorber providing a variable stiffness for different displacements. The energy absorber includes a skin portion attached to a bumper beam, a rib pivotally attached to an end of the skin portion and a reinforced element attached to an end of the rib. The rib is movable from a first position that provides a first stiffness for a first displacement to a second position providing a second stiffness greater than the first stiffness over a second displacement.<br><br>

            A vent register for a motor vehicle includes an integral scent-dispensing chamber configured for selectively allowing a vehicle heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) airflow therethrough. The scent-dispensing chamber includes a rear wall having one or more rear wall apertures and carrying a damper that is selectively translatable between an open configuration and a closed configuration to control a flow of conditioned air through the chamber. A selectively closeable scent-dispensing chamber front panel allows inserting or removing an air freshening substance.<br><br>
